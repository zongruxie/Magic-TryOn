**MagicTryOn** is a video virtual try-on framework based on a large-scale video diffusion Transformer. ***1) It adopts Wan2.1 diffusion Transformer as the backbone*** and ***2) employs full self-attention to model spatiotemporal consistency***. ***3) A coarse-to-fine garment preservation strategy is introduced, along with a mask-aware loss to enhance garment region fidelity***.

## 😉 Demo Inference
### 1. Image TryOn
You can directly run the following command to perform image try-on demo. If you want to modify some inference parameters, please make the changes inside the `predict_image_tryon_up.py` file.
```PowerShell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference/image_tryon/predict_image_tryon_up.py

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python inference/image_tryon/predict_image_tryon_low.py
```

### 2. Video TryOn
You can directly run the following command to perform image try-on demo. If you want to modify some inference parameters, please make the changes inside the `predict_video_tryon_up.py` file.
```PowerShell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference/video_tryon/predict_video_tryon_up.py

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python inference/video_tryon/predict_video_tryon_low.py
```

### 3. Customize TryOn
Before performing customized try-on, you need to complete the following five steps to obtain:

1. **Cloth Caption**  
   Generate a descriptive caption for the garment, which may be used for conditioning or multimodal control. We use [**Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct**](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) to obtain the caption. Before running, you need to specify the folder path.
   ```PowerShell
   python inference/customize/get_garment_caption.py
    ```

2. **Cloth Line Map**  
   Extract the structural lines or sketch of the garment using [**AniLines-Anime-Lineart-Extractor**](https://github.com/zhenglinpan/AniLines-Anime-Lineart-Extractor). Download the pre-trained models from this [**link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oazs4_X1Hppj-k9uqPD0HXWHEQLb9tNR/view?usp=sharing) and put them in the `inference/customize/AniLines/weights` folder.
   ```PowerShell
    python inference/customize/AniLines/infer.py --dir_in datasets/garment/vivo/vivo_garment --dir_out datasets/garment/vivo/vivo_garment_anilines --mode detail --binarize -1 --fp16 True --device cuda:1
    ```

3. **Mask**  
   Generate the agnostic mask of the garment, which is essential for region control during try-on. Please [**download**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E2JC_650g69AYrN2ZCwc8oz8qYRo5t5s/view?usp=sharing) the required checkpoint for obtaining the agnostic mask. The checkpoint needs to be placed in the `inference/customize/gen_mask/ckpt` folder.

   (1) You need to rename your video to `video.mp4`, and then construct the folders according to the following directory structure.
    ```
    ├── datasets
    │   ├── person
    |   |   ├── customize
    │   │   │   ├── video
    │   │   │   │   ├── 00001
    │   │   │   │   │   ├── video.mp4
    |   |   |   |   ├── 00002 ...
    │   │   │   ├── image
    │   │   │   │   ├── 00001
    │   │   │   │   │   │   ├── images
    │   │   │   │   │   │   │   ├── 0000.png
    |   |   |   |   ├── 00002 ...
    ```

    (2) Using `video2image.py` to convert the video into image frames and save them to `datasets/person/customize/video/00001/images`.

    (3) Run the following command to obtain the agnostic mask.

    ```PowerShell
    python inference/customize/gen_mask/app_mask.py
    # if extract the mask for lower_body or dresses, please modify line 65.
    # if lower_body:
    # mask, _ = get_mask_location('dc', "lower_body", model_parse, keypoints)
    # if dresses:
    # mask, _ = get_mask_location('dc', "dresses", model_parse, keypoints)
    ```

    After completing the above steps, you will obtain the agnostic masks for all video frames in the `datasets/person/customize/video/00001/masks` folder.
4. **Agnostic Representation**  
   Construct an agnostic representation of the person by removing garment-specific features. You can directly run `get_masked_person.py` to obtain the Agnostic Representation. Make sure to modify the `--image_folder` and `--mask_folder` parameters. The resulting video frames will be stored in `datasets/person/customize/video/00001/agnostic`.

5. **DensePose**  
   Use DensePose to obtain UV-mapped dense human body coordinates for better spatial alignment.

   (1) Install [**detectron2**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).

   (2) Run the following command:
   ```PowerShell
    bash inference/customize/detectron2/projects/DensePose/run.sh
    ```
    (3) The generated results will be stored in the `datasets/person/customize/video/00001/image-densepose` folder.

After completing the above steps, run the `image2video.py` file to generate the required customized videos: `mask.mp4`, `agnostic.mp4`, and `densepose.mp4`. Then, run the following command:
```PowerShell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference/video_tryon/predict_video_tryon_customize.py
```

## 😘 Acknowledgement
Our code is modified based on [VideoX-Fun](https://github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun/tree/main). We adopt [Wan2.1-I2V-14B](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1) as the base model. We use [SCHP](https://github.com/GoGoDuck912/Self-Correction-Human-Parsing/tree/master), [openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), and [DensePose](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DensePose) to generate masks. We use [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) to generate densepose. We use [Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) to generate the cloth caption and [AniLines-Anime-Lineart-Extractor](https://github.com/zhenglinpan/AniLines-Anime-Lineart-Extractor) to obtain the cloth line map.
